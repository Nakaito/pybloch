# pybloch
A simple, unoptimized Python class for plotting and showing quantum states on a Bloch sphere, built on the Matplotlib library.
This project serves multiple purposes, including helping me to: understand quantum, write useful standalone Python programs, and learn how to use Github. :)

This is a README-in-progress! I plan to update it more as I find the time.
